# Project Blueprint

## Overview

A "Coming Soon" page for the Pulse At ParkView project.

## Initial State

The project was a multi-section website for a fictional location called "Bridge Park".

## Current Plan

-   **Goal:** Transform the existing website into a "Coming Soon" page for "Pulse At ParkView".
-   **Steps:**
    1.  Replace the content of `index.html` with a simple "Coming Soon" message.
    2.  Update the title and heading to "Pulse At ParkView".
    3.  Remove the now unused `main.js` and `style.css` files to clean up the project.

## Recent Changes

- **Goal**: Make the hero section responsive on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Steps**:
    1. Created a new `style.css` file.
    2. Moved all CSS from `index2.html` to `style.css`.
    3. Linked `style.css` in `index2.html`.
    4. Modified the hero section CSS to be responsive.
