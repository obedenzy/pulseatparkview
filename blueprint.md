# Project Blueprint

## Overview

A "Coming Soon" page for the Pulse At ParkView project.

## Initial State

The project was a multi-section website for a fictional location called "Bridge Park".

## Current Plan

-   **Goal:** Transform the existing website into a "Coming Soon" page for "Pulse At ParkView".
-   **Steps:**
    1.  Replace the content of `index.html` with a simple "Coming Soon" message.
    2.  Update the title and heading to "Pulse At ParkView".
    3.  Remove the now unused `main.js` and `style.css` files to clean up the project.
